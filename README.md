# IDCalc: Isotope Distribution Calculator

Written by Michael J. MacCoss, Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington

IDCalc was developed to provide a simple way to view the expected isotope distribution  or biological molecules measured by mass spectrometry. The program also includes the the ability to consider enriched stable isotopes.

**Input:** Input is either as a peptide sequence or an elemental composition through the graphical user interface.

**Algorithm:** The algorithm for predicting the isotope distribution is based on the approach reported by Kubinyi, *Analytica Chimica Acta*, 247 (1991) 107-119. The C, H, O, and N isotope abundances are specific to biological molecules (Dwight E. Matthews personal communication). All other elemental isotope abundances were obtained from Biemann, *Mass Spectrometry, Organic Chemical Applications*, McGraw-Hill New York, 1962, p.59
